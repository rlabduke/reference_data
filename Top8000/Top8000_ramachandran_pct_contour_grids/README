Percentile contours for use in Ramachandran validation.

Files starting in rama8000 are the contours used for Ramachandran validation, and are drawn from the top8000 databases.

The rama.combined files are alternate contours which are smoothed and differentiable, allowing them to be used more like an energy landscape.  These contours are drawns from the top500 databases and steric clash data.
